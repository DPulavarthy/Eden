### About
Eden is a bot helper with simple to use slash commands. Created in Discord.JS v14, this bot is lightweight and fast. 

### Good to know
This bot supports running on docker and this repo contains some docker config files to run this bot (Some modifications needed). There is also a windows script incase you want a faster way to start the bot on docker.

Text and Image tags get saved under the `/cache` folder (this folder will be generated once you start the bot) and can be modified when the bot is offline, the bot will not "live-read" this directory so any changes made while the bot is online will cause the file(s) to be overwritten.

The `.env` file has only one field that is required: `TOKEN`. If not provided the bot will not work!

You can fork this repo and use it as you wish. Please report any issues you find under the issues tab.
